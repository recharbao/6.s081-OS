1. Which registers contain arguments to functions? For example, which register holds 13 in main's call to printf?
    
    As pointed out in riscv-spec-v, a0~a7 , fa0~fa7 are passed parameters.


2. Where is the function call to f from main? Where is the call to g? (Hint: the compiler may inline functions.).
    
    In the main function, there are only the change of the stack pointer and the storage of part of the register value. 
The explicit call function f is not found, but an immediate number 12 is found, 
which means that it should be in the compilation process and the compiler will process it. 
The f function calls the g function similarly.

3. At what address is the function printf located?

AUIPC forms a 32-bit offset from the 20-bit U-immediate, filling in the lowest 12 bits with
zeros, adds this offset to the pc, then places the result in register rd.
auipc	ra,0x0  may lock the pc value, jalr sets pc = ra + (1560), ra = pc + 8. 


4. What value is in the register ra just after the jalr to printf in main?

    After the printf function returns, pc = ra.
